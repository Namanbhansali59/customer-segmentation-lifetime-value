# Customer Segmentation and Lifetime Value Analysis

This repository contains a Python project for performing customer segmentation and predicting customer lifetime value using data analytics techniques.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics such as behavior, demographics, or purchasing patterns. By segmenting customers, businesses can 
tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to better meet the needs of different customer segments.

In this project, we use customer transaction data to perform customer segmentation and predict customer lifetime value. We apply the K-means clustering algorithm for segmentation and regression techniques 
for predicting lifetime value.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data.csv`: Sample dataset containing customer transaction data with features like Recency, Frequency, Monetary, and Lifetime Value.
- `customer_segmentation.py`: Python script for performing customer segmentation using K-means clustering.
- `lifetime_value_prediction.py`: Python script for predicting customer lifetime value using regression techniques.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/namanbhansali59/customer-segmentation-lifetime-value.git


2. Install the required dependencies (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn


3. Run the Python scripts to perform customer segmentation and predict customer lifetime value, respectively.
